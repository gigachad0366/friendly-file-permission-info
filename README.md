A simple script that shows a file permissions in a friendly way.

Usage: just run the script and pass the file as the argument.

How do i use it: i permanetly added it as a command by appending `alias perms=/<path_to_file>/perms.sh` to the end of the .bashrc

if you have it on your home directory, simply run: `echo "alias perms=~/perms.sh" >> .bashrc`

Or maybe place it somewhere under $PATH
